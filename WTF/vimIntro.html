# VIM editor
================================================================
## QUICK SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------
### takes fare amount of time to learn
### takes fare amount of time getting use to it
### but once you learn it, you can edit text files really FAST
-----------------------------------------------------------------



This is a text editor like TextEdit in OSX or notepad in Windows.
With huuuuuge amount of extra functions and extra codes that you
can use.

I don't even know one tenth of all functions in VIM but still find it
extremely useful to 

1. edit files
    + quick and simple functions to find and edit the words that you want

2. edit codes
    + syntax highlighting
    + auto-completion
    + searching through the directory 

3. help image processing
    + access terminal eg.read outputs of the commands straight into text

## How to run VIM

```
vi
```

or

```
vi text.txt
```

## to turn off
```
:q!  #forced quit
:q   #when there is no change in the text
:wq  #save and quit
```

Once you type this into your shell, it will show a blank screen with
few information about vi.

## Before you type anything into VIM

Unlike Microsoft word which you just move around and type, 
**VIM has three modes.**
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
###1. MOVE MODE
When you execute vi, you will go into the move mode
**Move with**
```
h  #left
j  #down
k  #up
l  #right
$  #end of the line
0  #first of the line
^  #first letter of the line
gg  #first line of the document
G  #last line of the document
w  #move forward by one ward
b  #move backward by one ward
Ctrl + D  #half page down
Ctrl + U  #half page up
```
*the movement keys that you use most often is all surrounded in the area where your fingers natually lay!!*

**Change into type mode**
```
i  #insert at the current position
a  #append after the current position
r  #replace the current position then append from next word
```
*try R,A,I too*


**Read output from the shell commands**
```
:r !ls     #output of the ls at the location
:r fslstats IMAGE.nii.gz -R    #output of fslstats of an image
```

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
###2. TYPE MODE
```
I love CCNC and neuroscience. Not!
```
You can just type anything that you want to. 

**back to move mode**
```
ESC
```
*I actually want to encourage you to contact me for 'vimrc' files*
*with extra short cuts. The vimrc file will change this ESC*
*and many other keys into more natually positioned keys so you can*
*type and edit faster. eg. ESC becomes 'jj'*


<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

###3. SELECT(AKA VISUAL) MODE

**Change into select mode from move mode**
```
v  #select by letters
V  #select by lines
```
*After typing v or V you can move around with the same key*

Copy and paste
```
y  #copy the selected
Y  #copy the whole line
p  #paste after the position
P  #paste before the position
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

##It's help page is amazing so I recommand using their 'help' by typing
```
:help
```
##in move mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------


**open different text on the split vim window**
```
:vs text.txt
```




<br><br><br><br><br>
```
. #repeat the previous command

q<letter> #record and assign it to <letter>
@<letter> #execute the record assigned to the <letter>

>> # indent the line 



`` # take you to the previous spot in the text
```
