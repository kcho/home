#Connectivity map thresholding
<br>
<br>
<br>
##What is this 'connectivity' value?
**The value is from**

###* Probabilistic tractography

    Seed : thalamus

    Target : eg)lateral prefrontal cortex



###* Output is this 'connectivity' value in each voxel which represent 

####the probability of tract arriving in the target 

####if tractography was calculated 5000 times.

####( number of tracts arriving in the target from the seed divided by 5000 )

<br>
<br>
<br>
##Why threshold?
**There must be a region in the thalamus which shows non-significant connection**

**However, they might result in tracts arriving in the target by chance**

So, I've thresholded the connectivities using various thresholds
ranging from 10% to 90% of robust range.
