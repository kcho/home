#Connectivity map thresholding
<br>
<br>
<br>
##What is this 'connectivity' value?
**The value is from**

###* Probabilistic tractography

    Seed : thalamus

    Target : eg)lateral prefrontal cortex



###* Output is this 'connectivity' value in each voxel which represent 

####the probability of tract arriving in the target 

####if tractography was calculated 5000 times.

####( number of tracts arriving in the target from the seed divided by 5000 )

<br>
<br>
<br>
##Why threshold?
**There must be a region in the thalamus which shows non-significant connection**

**However, they might result in tracts arriving in the target by chance**

So, I've thresholded the connectivities using various thresholds
ranging from 10% to 90% of robust range.

```
fslmaths <imgIn> -thrP <%threshold> <imgOut>
```

<br><br><br>
##Some significant differences only appear in certain thresholds...
**It could be explained as**


There is difference in regions(voxels) which have 
greater connection than certain value.

such as...

1. There might be different number voxels with higher connectivity values than threshold


2. Connection might be more stronger in those percentile having higher connectivity values


3. or Could be both of above cases
